# Autocomplete-TST


Implement autocomplete function with ternary search tree. Very low response time and input error tolerant. This function implemented for [Acempa](acemap.sjtu.edu.cn). 

If user inputs "Stan", we can show "Stanford University" for user. Also it can tolerant many types of error. If user types in "Stnaford"('a' and 'n' reversed), we can show correct "Stanford University". If user typee in "Stannford"('n' repeated), we can show correct "Stanford University".
